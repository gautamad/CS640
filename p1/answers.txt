Q2)
RTT:
----
Predicted RTT Latency between H1 and H4  = L1 + L2 + L3 = 160 ms 

Observed Value:
Average RTT = 161.88 ms


Throughput:
-----------
Predicted throughput = 20 Mbps (Slowest of all the links (S1->S2))

Observed Avg throughput = (22.22 + 17.66)/2 = 19.94 Mbps

Q3)
RTT with two hosts:
-------------------
Predicted:
Latency = 160 ms

Observed:
latency = 163.11 ms

The source and the destination switches are the same. The connection between all pairs of hosts also uses the same links. So this should not affect latency. 

Throughput with two hosts:
-------------------------
Predicted = 10 Mbps between h1 and h4
	    10 Mbps between h7 and h9

It gets equally divided

Observed = 10.015 Mbps between h1 and h4
	   10.84 Mbps between h7 and h9



RTT with three hosts:
--------------------
Predicted = 160 ms

Observed = 161 ms

The source and the destination switches are the same. The connection between all pairs of hosts also uses the same links. So this should not affect latency. 

Throughput wiht three hosts:
--------------------------
Predicted = 20/3 Mbps between h1->h4 , h7->h9 and h8->h10  each

Observed =  6.61 Mbps between h1 and h4
            5.32 Mbps between h8 and h10
	    10.24 Mbps between h7 and h9.

Since the connection between h7 and h9 was establised first, it had a higher bandwidth compared to the other two.
Overall the avg bandwidth was 7.39 Mbps for each of the three connections.


Q4)
RTT:
---------
Predicted = 160 ms

Observed = 161 ms

Latency is not affected in this case as the delay depends on only propogation delay because of negilible queueing delay since ping sends small packets which does not cause a delay at the switch 

Throughput:
----------
Predicted = 20 Mbps between h1 and h4 (since the slowest link is L1)
	    20 Mbps between h5 and h6 (L2 has 40 Mbps. However it is shared between the two connections=>40/2 Mbps)

Observed = 19.14 Mbps between h1 and h4, average	
	   21.14 Mbps between h5 and h6, average
